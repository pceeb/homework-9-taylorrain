# Peer Review

1. Yes.
2. Yes, it organizes data about plants for the user and puts it in an easy to read format.
3. The program takes the user input and runs it through a series of commands (grep, sed, etc.). Then it presents the user with a bulleted list of Genus and Species names.
4. Yes they’re in the workflow. No, they don’t appear to be Hoffman specific.
5. Yes there are instructions, but they don’t really tell the user how to use the program, they just explain what the program itself does. Maybe add a part that tells you what command to use to run the program.
6. No, it doesn’t say if a file is made.
7. Yes, they are.
8. Yes. 
9. This is not necessary according to Emily’s email.
10. It is a markdown file rather than a directory but yes.
11. Yes, i did using my prior knowledge but the instructions could be clearer.
12. Yes, I got the same result. 
13. I think the instructions portion is more like the workflow because it describes the commands used by the program but the way it reads it sounds like its a tutorial not a program so I had to go check the scripts to be sure. Fix that and also add more instructions on how to run the program.
